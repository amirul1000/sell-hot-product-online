Researchers have identified naturally occurring steroidal compounds in Tribulus terrestris.  These furostanol saponins stimulate testosterone production by suppressing natural hormone receptors. This results in the production of greater amounts of luteinizing hormone (LH) which in turn encourages the body, specifically the Leydig cells in the testes, to create more testosterone.
A recent study found Tribulus terrestris contributed to an increase in testosterone levels in men suffering from low testosterone, while another study demonstrated 'superior results' in the rejuvenation of sperm count

The aim of the clinical study was to evaluate the effect of Trigonella foenum-graecum extract on male libido (sexual drive, urge or desire) in a double blind randomized placebo controlled study /  testosterone levels remained within the reference range. It was concluded that Trigonella foenum-graecum demonstrated a significant positive effect on physiological aspects of libido and may assist to maintain normal healthy testosterone levels</p>

If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using ErectXL.
